# Getting Started with Pokédex

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Info

The project consists in showing a list of Pokémons and being able to see their details; currently, we are only fetching first 151 Pokémon, matching the original first generation, but it can be easily changed. To bring the information of the Pokémons, the following API has been used: https://pokeapi.co/. When accessing the application, a list of the Pokémons that we bring from the API will be displayed, showing the number of the Pokémon and its name; clicking on the name in the list will display the details of the selected Pokémon: the background color of the Pokémon card will change according to the type of Pokémon we are seeing.
